Predictive Maintenance

Use sensor data from machines to predict when maintenance should be performed to prevent unexpected failures. This will involve time-series analysis and possibly dealing with large, noisy datasets.


Metric to optimize : RMSE


See: https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k12/airplane/Animation/turbtyp/etfm.html


Goal: Predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of each engine in the test dataset based on the entire life cycle data


RUL is equivalent to the number of flights remaining for the engine after the last datapoint in the test dataset.
